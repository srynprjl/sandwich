.stack file is used to know that the project is initialized by .stack file.
.stack will contain the project information such as name, description, url and such ( except ID and UUID )
.stack will be used to auto add the project into the database. (before using this, need to convert category foreign key to use UID instead of ID, so that it doesnt mess up)
